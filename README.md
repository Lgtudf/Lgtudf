- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lgtudf / My friends call me Mark
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python,  and in the future, I want to try learning Java.
-    I am looking for advice on which language is best to learn to get a great job.
- 📫 How to reach me? Inst: Mark8492
- ⚡ Fun fact: Octopuses have three hearts. Two of them pump blood through the gills, where the blood is oxygenated,
-   and the third heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.
-   Additionally, octopus blood is blue because it contains copper instead of iron.
- 🗣️ What languages do I know? Russian, Ukrainian, German, and a little bit of English.
- Thanks to AI for the help! ;)
- P.S. My limited knowledge of English doesn’t stop me from writing code.
